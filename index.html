    <p>Gosh Hang It is a simple polyfill for the <code>hanging-punctuation</code> CSS property, which exists in the spec but is not supported by any major browser. The R. Buckminster Fuller quotes below are inside a container that has the <code>hanging-punctuation: first</code> rule applied to them.</p>

        &ldquo;I am enthusiastic over humanity’s extraordinary and sometimes &lsquo;very&rsquo; timely ingenuities. If
        you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you
        afloat that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best
        way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a
        great many piano tops in accepting yesterday’s fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only
        means for solving a given problem. Our brains deal exclusively with special-case experiences.
        Only our minds are able to discover the &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; principles operating without exception in
        each and every special-experience case which if detected and mastered will give knowledgeable
        advantage in all instances.&rdquo;

        &ldquo;Because our spontaneous initiative has been frustrated, too often inadvertently, in earliest
        childhood we do not tend, customarily, to dare to think competently regarding our potentials.
        We find it socially easier to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specializations and leave it to
        others&mdash;primarily to the politicians&mdash;to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas.
        Countering that spontaneous grownup trend to narrowness I will do my, hopefully &lsquo;childish,&rsquo;
        best to confront as many of our problems as possible by employing the longest-distance
        thinking of which I am capable&mdash;though that may not take us very far into the future.&rdquo;
