      &ldquo;I am enthusiastic over humanity’s extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If
      you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you
      afloat that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best
      way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a
      great many piano tops in accepting yesterday’s fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only
      means for solving a given problem. Our brains deal exclusively with special-case experiences.
      Only our minds are able to discover the generalized principles operating without exception in
      each and every special-experience case which if detected and mastered will give knowledgeable
      advantage in all instances.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Because our spontaneous initiative has been frustrated, too often inadvertently, in earliest
      childhood we do not tend, customarily, to dare to think competently regarding our potentials.
      We find it socially easier to go on with our narrow, shortsighted specialization&rsquo;s and leave it to
      others&mdash;primarily to the politicians&mdash;to find some way of resolving our common dilemmas.
      Countering that spontaneous grownup trend to narrowness I will do my, hopefully &lsquo;childish,&sdquo;
      best to confront as many of our problems as possible by employing the longest-distance
      thinking of which I am capable&mdash;though that may not take us very far into the future.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Having been trained at the U. S. Naval Academy and practically experienced in the
      powerfully effective forecasting arts of celestial navigation, pilotage, ballistics, and logistics, and
      in the long-range, anticipatory, design science governing yesterday’s naval mastery of the world
      from which our present day&rsquo;s general systems theory has been derived, I recall that in 1927 I
      set about deliberately exploring to see how far ahead we could make competent forecasts
      regarding the direction in which all humanity is trending and to see how effectively we could
      interpret the physical details of what comprehensive evolution might be portending as disclosed
      by the available data. I came to the conclusion that it is possible to make a fairly reasonable
      forecast of about twenty-five years. That seems to be about one industrial &lsquo;tooling&rsquo; generation.
      On the average, all inventions seem to get melted up about every twenty-five years, after which
      the metals come back into recirculation in new and usually more effective uses. At any rate, in
      1927 I evolved a forecast. Most of my 1927&rsquo;s prognosticating went only to 1952&mdash;that is, for a
      quarter-century, but some of it went on for a half-century, to 1977.&rdquo;
